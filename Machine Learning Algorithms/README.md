## 1. k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

#### Develop k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier in Python From Scratch
* I implemented k-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm in python from scratch using [iris.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv) dataset.

#### Develop k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier with Libraries
* I implemented k-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm in python with `KNeighborsClassifier` library using [diabetes.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/saurabh00007/diabetescsv) dataset.
